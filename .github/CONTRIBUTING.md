## <a name="question"></a> Questions and help
If you have an idea or question about something you think we can do to improve this application. Feel free to create a [feature request](#feature) and add your thoughts.

Or, if you found something not working when trying our application. [Report an issue](#issues) to help us improve the quality.

## <a name="issue"></a> Issues and Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by [submitting a ticket](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-an-issue) to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AxessLab/typing/issues). Even better, you can submit a Pull Request to our [Typing in the dark project](https://github.com/AxessLab/typing/pulls).

## <a name="feature"></a> Feature Requests

You can request a new feature by submitting a ticket to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AxessLab/typing/issues). If you
would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

-   **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first. Please open a ticket which clearly states that it is a feature request in the title and explain clearly what you want to achieve in the description, and we will discuss with you what should be done in that ticket. You can then start working on a Pull Request. 
-   **Small Changes** can be proposed without any discussion. Open up a ticket which clearly states that it is a feature request in the title. Explain your change in the description, and you can propose a Pull Request straight away.

## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

-   Web apps JavaScript files **may follow** [Google's JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).
-   React/Redux Typescript files **may follow** the [React/Redux Typescript guide](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide).
-   CSS **may follow** the [BEM convention](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
